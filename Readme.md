Here I will keep my notes on a programming language I'd like to code in. I am not final on what and how it should support, but ~~all~~ the design decisions tend to keep it as simple as possible, so it can be implemented fairly easily. I'd roughly describe it as a cross between [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org/) and [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) with a baked-in [ZIO](https://github.com/zio/zio).

The name is intentionally chosen to be a homophone to the [C language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), to spread confusion amongst the ones discussing it.
