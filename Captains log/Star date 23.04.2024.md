It turned out that the environment wrapped around agents was unusable. At some point I had to either implement a stack of agents or drop them and just use lists. The latter was implemented.

We are able to evaluate *atoms*, *numbers*, *conds*, *lambdas*, *quotes* and *application*. I want to add *define*, will start with naming atoms and application, then will introduce the *named functions*.
