I was unable to code a recursion in Sea via Y-combinator. It seems the code is correct /both Sea and Elixir/, but the process stops after first iteration.

I need to trace the evaluation to understand what went wrong there. I'll start with a debug level of logging to a file but I think I'll need a tool for stack inspection quite soon. I also have some ideas of how it should look and feel.
