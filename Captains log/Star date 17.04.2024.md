The environment is done. Now we map expressions to actions.

I will start with only 6 types of expressions /as in the little schemer/:
- const ....... atom
- identifier .. atom
- cond ........ atom
- quote ....... atom
- lambda ...... list
- application . list

Once this is done, we'll think of other forms.
