The failure to evaluate `[length-y](../seac/test/fixtures/length-y.sea)` issue was due to invalid evaluation of `cdr`. `car` was broken as well. Now they are fixed and *Sea* is technically a programming language.

I think it is time to stop pushing through, and look around and clean up for a while. I was hesitant of adding the `define`, and since the Y combinator works, I'll postpone adding it.
