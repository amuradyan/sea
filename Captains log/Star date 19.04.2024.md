The mappings are done. Now the evaluation: the last, and, probably, the most time consuming piece of work to get us a working interpreter.

I have to consider when and where we should start checking for program validity. I believe a simple program abstraction would be sufficient to just detect and handle malformed expressions. This might also be a good playground for some error reporting action.
